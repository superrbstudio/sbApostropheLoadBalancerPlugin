sbApostropheLoadBalancerPlugin

Plugin allows sessions to be stored in a doctrine database so that they can be served consistently across 
multiple server architectures.

Currently Superrb Studio uses GlusterFS (http://www.gluster.org/) to syncronise media assets, cache and apostrophe 
files between servers.

The following directories are mounted on a GlusterFS share
cache/
data/a_writable/
web/uploads/

All PHP files are connected to a GIT repository and don't need to be syncronised as they don't change. Just remember 
to pull updates on all servers in a cluster! 



Built for the Symfony PHP framework and Apostrophe CMS system.

# Symfony

Symfony is a complete framework designed to optimize the development of web applications by way of several key features.
For starters, it separates a web application's business rules, server logic, and presentation views.
It contains numerous tools and classes aimed at shortening the development time of a complex web application.
Additionally, it automates common tasks so that the developer can focus entirely on the specifics of an application.
The end result of these advantages means there is no need to reinvent the wheel every time a new web application is built!

Symfony was written entirely in PHP 5.
It has been thoroughly tested in various real-world projects, and is actually in use for high-demand e-business websites.
It is compatible with most of the available databases engines, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.
It runs on *nix and Windows platforms.
